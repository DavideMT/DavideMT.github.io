We study the impact of \\( q\bar{q}' W \\) and \\( q\bar{q}' WH \\) interactions, originating from dimension-six operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), on the Higgs boson associated production \\(pp \to W^+H \\) at the LHC. We compute the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to this process and compare these corrections in the Standard Model and SMEFT production mechanisms.
