## Basics of Lorentz symmetry on spacetime and fields [pdf](../files/Notes_Basics_QFT.pdf){: .btn--icon}
Here I have compiled some details regarding the effects of Lorentz transformations both on spacetime and on fields. These notes should be understood as a collection of thoughts that might be worth reading before approaching an introductory course in Quantum Field Theory.

## Exercises of Quantum Field Theory [pdf](../files/QFT_exercises.pdf){: .btn--icon}
Here are the solutions to introductory exercises in Quantum Field Theory, as proposed by [Prof. Stefano Forte](https://pcforte.mi.infn.it/ft/index.html) on his webpage. If you would like to contribute to the creation of new exercises to expand this collection, please feel free to contact me at [davide.tagliabue@unimi.it](mailto:davide.tagliabue@unimi.it).

## Scattering Amplitudes in Quantum Field Theory [pdf](../files/Lecture_Notes_Scattering_Amplitudes.pdf){: .btn--icon}
Here you can find a prototype version of a collection of notes that I am writing in collaboration with Sara Ditsch, Julian Piribauer, and [Prof.&nbsp;Lorenzo Tancredi](https://www.ph.nat.tum.de/ttpmath/home/). These notes are based on material conceived by Prof. Lorenzo Tancredi and constitute the content of two entire courses in Quantum Field Theory that he teaches at TUM.
